### 📜 Problem Description

You are given an integer array  `coins`  representing coins of different denominations and an integer  `k` .

You have an infinite number of coins of each denomination. However, you are  **not allowed**  to combine coins of different denominations.

Return the  `kth`   **smallest**  amount that can be made using these coins.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  coins = [3,6,9], k = 3

**Output:**   9

**Explanation:**  The given coins can make the following amounts:

Coin 3 produces multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.

Coin 6 produces multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, etc.

Coin 9 produces multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, 36, etc.

All of the coins combined produce: 3, 6,  **9** , 12, 15, etc.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  coins = [5,2], k = 7

**Output:**  12

**Explanation:**  The given coins can make the following amounts:

Coin 5 produces multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.

Coin 2 produces multiples of 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc.

All of the coins combined produce: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10,  **12** , 14, 15, etc.

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= coins.length <= 15`
	
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 25`
	
- `1 <= k <= 2 * 109`
	
- `coins`  contains pairwise distinct integers.
